# Forecasting with the Long Short-Term Memory Network
The control process of LSTM is similar to that of RNN, both of which process the data flowing through the cell in the process of forward propagation. The difference lies in that the structure and computation of the cell in LSTM have changed. LSTM model shows great promise in learning and observing long sequences. This approach seems to be a perfect match for solving time series prediction problems.

This project will be divided into the following seven parts, they are: 1. Get MSFT stock price data; 2. Create a test session; 3. Persistence Model Forecast which is used to create Baseline directly from the training data; 4. LSTM data preparation; 5. LSTM model development; 6. LSTM for prediction; 7. Complete the LSTM sample.
